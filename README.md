Step counting game

Still totally new to this Android thing (minus one introductory class in college), so this is kind of a learning project while I'm off on mat leave.

This will, hopefully, be kind of like a classic Pokemon game that encourages you to get off your butt and go for a walk. Every x number of steps, you either find a random Pokemon to battle and catch, find a trainer to battle, or find an item. I'm making it up as I go, really. Never made a game before (played quite a few, though), so this is all new to me. SO, in the off-chance someone stumbles upon here and wants to give me suggestions or advice, please feel free to do so. :)
