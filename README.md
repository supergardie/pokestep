Step counting game

Still totally new to this Android thing (minus one introductory class in college), so this is kind of a learning project while I'm off on mat leave.

This will, hopefully, be kind of like a classic Pokemon game that encourages you to get off your butt and go for a walk. Every x number of steps, you either find a random Pokemon to battle and catch, find a trainer to battle, or find an item. I'm making it up as I go, really. Never made a game before (played quite a few, though), so this is all new to me. SO, in the off-chance someone stumbles upon here and wants to give me suggestions or advice, please feel free to do so. :)

I found [this pedometer code](http://www.gadgetsaint.com/android/create-pedometer-step-counter-android/#.WNwdmxJ97fY) and am using it as my base. To be honest, I'm not sure how it works. I should really work on figuring that out... later. For now, I'm going to focus on the fun part of actually making something. I should probably remember [this page from the Android docs](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.4.html#UserInput) as well as [this page from the Android docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor.html#TYPE_STEP_COUNTER)
